Finding your own token is pretty simple:
   . Sign into your Plex Account in Plex Web App
   . Browse to a library item and view the XML for it
   . Look in the URL and find the token
   . Replace this whole text with the token id, save the file and remove the ".txt" at the end of the filename

Some PMS verions (Windows) do not need require authentication to give access to the library XML file (Windows ?)
